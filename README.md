# ExtractWebPages
This is my first attempt in using Selenium and Chrome Driver to extract text from three Indian Web Sites. 
To build the code you need to download Maven and JDK 1.8
To run the code download ChromeDriver and pass the following as VM Parameter
-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="H:\selenium-2.43.1\chromedriver.exe"
